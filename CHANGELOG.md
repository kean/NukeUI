## NukeUI 0.6.3

## NukeUI 0.6.1

*Jun 11, 2021*

- Fix default placeholder color for `LazyImage`
- Update `LazyImageView` to match `LazyImage` in terms of the default parameters: placeholder and animation

## NukeUI 0.6.0

*Jun 11, 2021*

- Add `ImageView` (UIKit, AppKit) and `Image` (SwiftUI) components that support animated images and are now used by `LazyImageView`
- Remove `LazyImageView` API for setting image, use `ImageView` directly instead
- Fix reloading when the source changes but view identity is the same
- All views now support video rendering by default
- Rename `contentMode` to `resizingMode`
- `LazyImage` custom initialized now suggest `NukeUI.Image`

## NukeUI 0.5.0

*Jun 10, 2021*

- Rework `LazyImage` to use `FetchImage` on all platforms
- Add new `init(source:content:)` initializer to `LazyImage`:

```swift
LazyImage(source: $0) { state in
    if let image = state.image {
        image // Displays the loaded image
    } else if state.error != nil {
        Color.red // Indicates an error
    } else {
        Color.blue // Acts as a placeholder
    }
}
```

- Add default placeholder to `LazyImage` (gray background) 
- Temporarily increase `LazyImage` supported platforms to iOS 14.0, tvOS 14.0, watchOS 7.0, macOS 10.16
- `LazyImage` on watchOS now has an almost complete feature parity with other platforms. The main exception is the support for animated images which is currently missing.
- Remove `LazyImage` initializer that take `ImageContainer` – use `LazyImageView` directly instead
- Add infrastructure for registering custom rendering engines:

```swift
import SwiftSVG

// Affects both all `LazyImage` and `LazyImageView` instances
LazyImageView.registerContentView {
    if $0.type == .svg, let string = $0.data.map( {
        UIView(SVGData: data)
    }
    return nil
}
```

- Add access to the underlying `videoPlayerView`, remove separate `videoGravity` property
